# CONTRIBUTING Guidelines

## Quantum and Web3 Alignment

We're excited about contributions that align quantum computing principles and Web3 technologies. Here’s a guideline for you to follow:

1. **Quantum Principles**: Ensure your contributions leverage or enhance algorithms, protocols, or systems that integrate quantum computing with the goals of this repository.
2. **Web3 Synergy**: Contributions should also extend or complement blockchain or Web3 technologies, maintaining a decentralized and secure outlook.
3. **Collaboration**: Open constructive discussions through issues to elaborate on your intended contributions; maintain a collaborative demeanor.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Submit contributions with proper tests and proofs-of-concept, especially for hybrid quantum-Web3 systems.

Happy contributing!
